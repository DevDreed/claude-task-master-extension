- **Progressive enhancement** - full features without MCP, enhanced with MCP
- **Bulletproof reliability** - robust CLI fallback ensures no broken functionality
- **Production tested** - comprehensive test suite with 87 tests
- **Professional quality** - ready for enterprise and personal development workflows

### Design Philosophy
This extension is designed as a **pure enhancement** to task-master-ai, working alongside existing CLI and MCP tools without competing with the original functionality. It provides a modern visual interface while respecting the architecture and design of the core task-master-ai system.
